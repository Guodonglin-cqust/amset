For every scattering mechanism, the scattering rates are calculated at each band and k-point in the band structure. This is achieved through the differential scattering rate, s_b(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) s_b(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) , which gives the rate of scattering from k-point, \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{k} , to a second k-point, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime \\mathbf{k}^\\prime , in band b b . The overall scattering rate for each k-point and band is obtained by integrating the differential scattering rates over the full Brillouin zone. Umklapp-type scattering is included by considering periodic boundary conditions. In this section we report the differential scattering rate equation and references for each mechanism. More information about how carrier transport properties are calculated is given in the theory section . Overview \u00b6 Below, we give a summary of each mechanism, its abbreviation, and the material parameters needed to calculate it.

The -\\hbar \\omega_\\mathrm{po} -\\hbar \\omega_\\mathrm{po} and +\\hbar \\omega_\\mathrm{po} +\\hbar \\omega_\\mathrm{po} terms correspond to scattering by phonon absorption and emission, respectively. The phonon density of states is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution, according to N_\\mathrm{po} = \\frac{1}{\\exp (\\hbar \\omega_\\mathrm{po} / k_\\mathrm{B} T) - 1}. N_\\mathrm{po} = \\frac{1}{\\exp (\\hbar \\omega_\\mathrm{po} / k_\\mathrm{B} T) - 1}. Polar optical phonon scattering information Abbreviation: POP Type: Inelastic References: 5 , 6 , 1 Requires: pop_frequency , static_dielectric , high_frequency_dielectric Overlap integral \u00b6 Each differential scattering rate equation depends on the integral overlap, G_b(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) G_b(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) , which gives the degree of orbital overlap between a k-point, \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{k} and a second k-point, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime \\mathbf{k}^\\prime , in band b b . In general, calculating the overlap integral between two k-points requires access to the wavefunctions of the states of interest. For interpolated band structures, this poses a problem as the wavefunctions now must also be interpolated. In AMSET, we use an approximation for the orbital integral based on the projected orbital contributions. Currently, a simple expression for the overlap is used, however, in future releases a more sophisticated expression will be developed. The orbital integral is implemented as G_b(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) = (a_{b,\\mathbf{k}} a_{b,\\mathbf{k^\\prime}} + c_{b,\\mathbf{k}} c_{b,\\mathbf{k^\\prime}} x )^2, G_b(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) = (a_{b,\\mathbf{k}} a_{b,\\mathbf{k^\\prime}} + c_{b,\\mathbf{k}} c_{b,\\mathbf{k^\\prime}} x )^2, where x x is the cosine of the angle between \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{k} and \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) , and a a and c c depend on the s ( \\phi_s \\phi_s ) and p -orbital projections ( \\phi_p \\phi_p ) as: \\begin{align} a_{b,\\mathbf{k}} = {}& \\frac{\\phi_{s,b,\\mathbf{k}}} {\\sqrt{(\\phi_{s,b,\\mathbf{k}}^2 + \\phi_{p,b,\\mathbf{k}}^2)}}, \\\\ c_{b,\\mathbf{k}} = {}& \\sqrt{1 - a_{b,\\mathbf{k}}^2}. \\end{align} \\begin{align} a_{b,\\mathbf{k}} = {}& \\frac{\\phi_{s,b,\\mathbf{k}}} {\\sqrt{(\\phi_{s,b,\\mathbf{k}}^2 + \\phi_{p,b,\\mathbf{k}}^2)}}, \\\\ c_{b,\\mathbf{k}} = {}& \\sqrt{1 - a_{b,\\mathbf{k}}^2}. \\end{align} The justification for the above form of the overlap integral is given in 1 . Brillouin zone integration \u00b6 All scattering rate equations depend on the Dirac delta function, \\delta(E - E^\\prime) \\delta(E - E^\\prime) , which is 1 when the energy of the two states E E and E^\\prime E^\\prime are equal and 0 otherwise. Due to finite k-point sampling and numerical noise, it is unlikely that two states will ever have exactly the same energy. To account for this, we replace the Dirac function with a Gaussian distribution, according to \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\exp{ \\left ( \\frac{E - E^\\prime}{\\sigma} \\right )^2} \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\exp{ \\left ( \\frac{E - E^\\prime}{\\sigma} \\right )^2} where \\sigma \\sigma is the broadening width. The overall scattering rate at k-point, \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{k} , and band, b b , can therefore be calculated as a discrete summation over all k-points in the Brillouin zone. I.e., s_b(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\Omega}{N_\\mathrm{kpts}} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k} \\neq \\mathbf{k}^\\prime}^{\\mathbf{k}^\\prime} s_b(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime), s_b(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\Omega}{N_\\mathrm{kpts}} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k} \\neq \\mathbf{k}^\\prime}^{\\mathbf{k}^\\prime} s_b(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime), where N_\\mathrm{kpts} N_\\mathrm{kpts} is the total number of k-points in the full Brillouin zone and \\Omega \\Omega is the reciprocal lattice volume.

In general, calculating the overlap integral between two k-points requires access to the wavefunctions of the states of interest. For interpolated band structures, this poses a problem as the wavefunctions now must also be interpolated. In AMSET, we use an approximation for the orbital integral based on the projected orbital contributions. Currently, a simple expression for the overlap is used, however, in future releases a more sophisticated expression will be developed. The orbital integral is implemented as G_b(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) = (a_{b,\\mathbf{k}} a_{b,\\mathbf{k^\\prime}} + c_{b,\\mathbf{k}} c_{b,\\mathbf{k^\\prime}} x )^2, G_b(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) = (a_{b,\\mathbf{k}} a_{b,\\mathbf{k^\\prime}} + c_{b,\\mathbf{k}} c_{b,\\mathbf{k^\\prime}} x )^2, where x x is the cosine of the angle between \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{k} and \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) , and a a and c c depend on the s ( \\phi_s \\phi_s ) and p -orbital projections ( \\phi_p \\phi_p ) as: \\begin{align} a_{b,\\mathbf{k}} = {}& \\frac{\\phi_{s,b,\\mathbf{k}}} {\\sqrt{(\\phi_{s,b,\\mathbf{k}}^2 + \\phi_{p,b,\\mathbf{k}}^2)}}, \\\\ c_{b,\\mathbf{k}} = {}& \\sqrt{1 - a_{b,\\mathbf{k}}^2}. \\end{align} \\begin{align} a_{b,\\mathbf{k}} = {}& \\frac{\\phi_{s,b,\\mathbf{k}}} {\\sqrt{(\\phi_{s,b,\\mathbf{k}}^2 + \\phi_{p,b,\\mathbf{k}}^2)}}, \\\\ c_{b,\\mathbf{k}} = {}& \\sqrt{1 - a_{b,\\mathbf{k}}^2}. \\end{align} The justification for the above form of the overlap integral is given in 1 .","title":"Overlap integral"},{"location":"scattering/#brillouin-zone-integration","text":"All scattering rate equations depend on the Dirac delta function, \\delta(E - E^\\prime) \\delta(E - E^\\prime) , which is 1 when the energy of the two states E E and E^\\prime E^\\prime are equal and 0 otherwise.

Elastic scattering is completely randomizing and has no effect on f f , i.e., s(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) \\equiv s(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, \\mathbf{k}), s(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) \\equiv s(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, \\mathbf{k}), whereas ineleastic scattering is not randomizing and does affect f f , namely s(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) \\neq s(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, \\mathbf{k}). s(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) \\neq s(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, \\mathbf{k}). This results from the different rates for emission and absorption processes in inelastic scattering. Accordingly, we define the scattering out rate from k-point, \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{k} , as s_\\mathrm{out}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\int \\left [ s( \\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime ) (1 - f^\\prime) + s(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, \\mathbf{k}) f^\\prime \\right ] \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, s_\\mathrm{out}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\int \\left [ s( \\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime ) (1 - f^\\prime) + s(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, \\mathbf{k}) f^\\prime \\right ] \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, and scattering in rate to k-point, \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{k} , as s_\\mathrm{in}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\int X g^\\prime \\left [ s(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, \\mathbf{k}) (1 - f) + s(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) f \\right ] \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, s_\\mathrm{in}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\int X g^\\prime \\left [ s(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, \\mathbf{k}) (1 - f) + s(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) f \\right ] \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, where f=f(\\mathbf{k}) f=f(\\mathbf{k}) , f^\\prime = f(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime) f^\\prime = f(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime) , g^\\prime = g(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime) g^\\prime = g(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime) and X X is the angle between \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{k} and \\mathbf{k}^\\prime \\mathbf{k}^\\prime . Iterative Boltzmann transport \u00b6 As detailed in Rode 1 , the perturbation to the total distribution function can be written, g (\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{s_\\mathrm{in}(g, \\mathbf{k})- \\frac{e \\mathbf{F}}{\\hbar} \\nabla_\\mathbf{k} f_\\mathrm{T} (\\mathbf{k}, T)} {s_\\mathrm{out}(\\mathbf{k}) + s_\\mathrm{el}(\\mathbf{k})} g (\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{s_\\mathrm{in}(g, \\mathbf{k})- \\frac{e \\mathbf{F}}{\\hbar} \\nabla_\\mathbf{k} f_\\mathrm{T} (\\mathbf{k}, T)} {s_\\mathrm{out}(\\mathbf{k}) + s_\\mathrm{el}(\\mathbf{k})} As g g depends upon itself, an iterative procedure is needed to solve the perturbation to the distribution function. Fortunately, the functional form of g g ensures it converges exponentially, in most cases requiring fewer than 5 iterations to achieve accurate results. In the absence of inelastic scattering, s_\\mathrm{in}(g) = 0 s_\\mathrm{in}(g) = 0 and g_1 g_1 , is the exact solution. In addition, the g_1 g_1 solution is often termed the relaxation time approximation (RTA). Calculating transport properties \u00b6 Transport properties are calculated using the transport density of states (DOS), defined as: \\sigma(E, T) = \\int \\sum_b \\mathbf{v}_{b,\\mathbf{k}} \\otimes \\mathbf{v}_{b,\\mathbf{k}} \\tau_{b,\\mathbf{k},T} \\delta (E - E_{b, \\mathbf{k}}) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{k}}{8 \\pi^3}, \\sigma(E, T) = \\int \\sum_b \\mathbf{v}_{b,\\mathbf{k}} \\otimes \\mathbf{v}_{b,\\mathbf{k}} \\tau_{b,\\mathbf{k},T} \\delta (E - E_{b, \\mathbf{k}}) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{k}}{8 \\pi^3}, where \\mathbf{v}_{b, \\mathbf{k}} \\mathbf{v}_{b, \\mathbf{k}} is the group velocity of k-point, \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{k} in band, b b , \\tau \\tau is the lifetime defined as 1/s(\\mathbf{k}) 1/s(\\mathbf{k}) and E E is energy. The transport DOS is used to calculate the moments of the generalized transport coefficients \\mathcal{L}^{(\\alpha)}(E_\\mathrm{F}, T) = q^2 \\int \\sigma(E, T)(E - E_\\mathrm{F})^\\alpha \\left ( - \\frac{ \\delta f_\\mathrm{T}(E, E_\\mathrm{F}, T)}{\\delta E} \\right ) \\mathrm{d}E, \\mathcal{L}^{(\\alpha)}(E_\\mathrm{F}, T) = q^2 \\int \\sigma(E, T)(E - E_\\mathrm{F})^\\alpha \\left ( - \\frac{ \\delta f_\\mathrm{T}(E, E_\\mathrm{F}, T)}{\\delta E} \\right ) \\mathrm{d}E, where E_\\mathrm{F} E_\\mathrm{F} is the Fermi level at doping concentration, c c .
