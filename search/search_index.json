Under low field conditions, the total distribution function, f T f_\\mathrm{T} f T \u200b , is f T ( k ) = f ( k ) + x g ( k ) , f_\\mathrm{T}(\\mathbf{k}) = f(\\mathbf{k}) + xg(\\mathbf{k}), f T \u200b ( k ) = f ( k ) + x g ( k ) , where x x x is the cosine of the angle between F \\mathbf{F} F and k \\mathbf{k} k , g g g is the perturbation part of the distribution. and f f f is the distribution at equilibrium (Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution), given as f = 1 e ( E \u2212 E F ) / k B T + 1 f = \\frac{1}{e^{(E-E_\\mathrm{F})/k_\\mathrm{B}T} + 1} f = e ( E \u2212 E F \u200b ) / k B \u200b T + 1 1 \u200b Elastic versus inelastic scattering \u00b6 The perturbation is dependent on the scattering rate s s s . The differential scattering rate from state k \\mathbf{k} k to k \u2032 \\mathbf{k}^\\prime k \u2032 is given as s ( k , k \u2032 ) = s i n e l ( k , k \u2032 ) + s e l ( k , k \u2032 ) s(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime ) = s_\\mathrm{inel} (\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime ) + s_\\mathrm{el} (\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime ) s ( k , k \u2032 ) = s i n e l \u200b ( k , k \u2032 ) + s e l \u200b ( k , k \u2032 ) where the subscripts e l \\mathrm{el} e l and i n e l \\mathrm{inel} i n e l refer to elastic and inelastic scattering processes, respectively. Elastic scattering is completely randomizing and has no effect on f f f , i.e., s ( k , k \u2032 ) \u2261 s ( k \u2032 , k ) , s(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) \\equiv s(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, \\mathbf{k}), s ( k , k \u2032 ) \u2261 s ( k \u2032 , k ) , whereas ineleastic scattering is not randomizing and does affect f f f , i.e., s ( k , k \u2032 ) \u2260 s ( k \u2032 , k ) . s(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) \\neq s(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, \\mathbf{k}). s ( k , k \u2032 ) \ue020 \u200b = s ( k \u2032 , k ) . The non-randomizing behaviour follows from the different rates for emission and absorption processes in inelastic scattering. Accordingly, we define the scattering out rate from k-point, k \\mathbf{k} k , as s o u t ( k ) = \u222b [ s ( k , k \u2032 ) ( 1 \u2212 f \u2032 ) + s ( k \u2032 , k ) f \u2032 ] d k \u2032 , s_\\mathrm{out}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\int \\left [ s( \\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime ) (1 - f^\\prime) + s(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, \\mathbf{k}) f^\\prime \\right ] \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, s o u t \u200b ( k ) = \u222b [ s ( k , k \u2032 ) ( 1 \u2212 f \u2032 ) + s ( k \u2032 , k ) f \u2032 ] d k \u2032 , and scattering in rate to k-point, k \\mathbf{k} k , as s i n ( k ) = \u222b X g \u2032 [ s ( k \u2032 , k ) ( 1 \u2212 f ) + s ( k , k \u2032 ) f ] d k \u2032 , s_\\mathrm{in}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\int X g^\\prime \\left [ s(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, \\mathbf{k}) (1 - f) + s(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}^\\prime) f \\right ] \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{k}^\\prime, s i n \u200b ( k ) = \u222b X g \u2032 [ s ( k \u2032 , k ) ( 1 \u2212 f ) + s ( k , k \u2032 ) f ] d k \u2032 , where f = f ( k ) f=f(\\mathbf{k}) f = f ( k ) , f \u2032 = f ( k \u2032 ) f^\\prime = f(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime) f \u2032 = f ( k \u2032 ) , g \u2032 = g ( k \u2032 ) g^\\prime = g(\\mathbf{k}^\\prime) g \u2032 = g ( k \u2032 ) and X X X is the angle between k \\mathbf{k} k and k \u2032 \\mathbf{k}^\\prime k \u2032 . Iterative Boltzmann transport \u00b6 As detailed in Rode 1 , the perturbation to the total distribution function can be written, g ( k ) = s i n ( g , k ) \u2212 e F \u210f \u2207 k f T ( k , T ) s o u t ( k ) + s e l ( k ) g (\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{s_\\mathrm{in}(g, \\mathbf{k})- \\frac{e \\mathbf{F}}{\\hbar} \\nabla_\\mathbf{k} f_\\mathrm{T} (\\mathbf{k}, T)} {s_\\mathrm{out}(\\mathbf{k}) + s_\\mathrm{el}(\\mathbf{k})} g ( k ) = s o u t \u200b ( k ) + s e l \u200b ( k ) s i n \u200b ( g , k ) \u2212 \u210f e F \u200b \u2207 k \u200b f T \u200b ( k , T ) \u200b As g g g depends upon itself, an iterative procedure is needed to solve the perturbation to the distribution function. Fortunately, the functional form of g g g ensures it converges exponentially, in most cases requiring fewer than 5 iterations to achieve accurate results. In the absence of inelastic scattering, s i n ( g ) = 0 s_\\mathrm{in}(g) = 0 s i n \u200b ( g ) = 0 and g 1 g_1 g 1 \u200b , is the exact solution. In addition, the g 1 g_1 g 1 \u200b solution is often termed the relaxation time approximation (RTA). Currently, AMSET only support the RTA but the full iterative solution will be added in a future release. Calculating transport properties \u00b6 Transport properties are calculated using the transport density of states (DOS), defined as: \u03c3 ( E , T ) = \u222b \u2211 n v n k \u2297 v n k \u03c4 n k , T \u03b4 ( E \u2212 E n k ) d k 8 \u03c0 3 , \\sigma(E, T) = \\int \\sum_n \\mathbf{v}_{n\\mathbf{k}} \\otimes \\mathbf{v}_{n\\mathbf{k}} \\tau_{n\\mathbf{k},T} \\delta (E - E_{n\\mathbf{k}}) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{k}}{8 \\pi^3}, \u03c3 ( E , T ) = \u222b n \u2211 \u200b v n k \u200b \u2297 v n k \u200b \u03c4 n k , T \u200b \u03b4 ( E \u2212 E n k \u200b ) 8 \u03c0 3 d k \u200b , where v n k \\mathbf{v}_{n\\mathbf{k}} v n k \u200b is the group velocity of k-point k \\mathbf{k} k and band n n n , \u03c4 n k \\tau_{n\\mathbf{k}} \u03c4 n k \u200b is the lifetime defined as 1 / s n ( k ) 1/s_n(\\mathbf{k}) 1 / s n \u200b ( k ) and E E E is energy.
